From vocational courses to professional courses like MBA, all are really helpful for art students. Whether you want a managerial position or want a creative job in fine arts, a course in humanities or arts can help achieve all your career goals. Event management, aviation courses, B.H.M and Bachelor of Statistics are some of the courses after 12th for art students. Animation, design, entertainment, painting, photography, fashion, and food are some of the common industries where art students can get lucrative jobs. </p>

<P>Bachelor’s degree courses: The most obvious option is to opt for an undergraduate degree programme in a subject you like. While you can select a specific subject area while pursuing a BA (Honours) course, you may also choose the BA (Pass) course if you find that you have not secured enough marks to pursue an Honours programme. However, the professional choices after course completion will be much less in the case of a Pass course. Thus, we suggest going for a decent college to do BA (Honours) if you meet the cut-off. You may take up a Bachelor’s degree course in sociology, psychology, history, political science, philosophy, English, geography, fine arts, public administration, and such subjects. There are several excellent colleges in Delhi University, Mumbai University, and other top universities across the nation.</P>

<p>Professionally oriented choices: Apart from the academic career opportunities after 12th, you can go for the above-discussed professional courses that any art student may take up. However, you can even get admission in courses like CA (chartered accountant) or CS (company secretary) after you complete 12th standard in arts stream. Do not think that these options are only open to commerce students. From air ticketing and jewellery making to cinematography and event management, you can do diplomas and degree programmes in any of the domains and do well in your professional career.</p>
<ul>
